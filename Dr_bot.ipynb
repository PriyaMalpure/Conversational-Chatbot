Data has shown that it spreads from person to person among those in close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters). The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes or talks. These droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth or nose of a person nearby.\n",

feet, or 2 meters).', 'The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes or talks.', 'These droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth or nose of a person nearby.', \"It can also spread if a person touches a surface with the virus on it and then touches his or her mouth, nose or eyes, although this isn't considered to be a main way it spreads.\",

face with a cloth face mask in public spaces, such as the grocery store, where it's difficult to avoid close contact with others, especially if you're in an area with ongoing community spread.\",
